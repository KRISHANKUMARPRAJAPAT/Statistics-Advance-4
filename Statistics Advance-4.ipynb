    "The margin of error (MOE) in a confidence interval (CI) is a measure of the uncertainty or precision associated with the estimate of a population parameter based on a sample. It indicates the range within which we expect the true population parameter to lie with a certain level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical terms, when we calculate a confidence interval for a population parameter (e.g., mean, proportion), we use a sample statistic (e.g., sample mean, sample proportion) to estimate the true population parameter. The margin of error is the maximum amount by which the sample statistic is likely to differ from the true population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error is directly related to the level of confidence chosen for the interval and the variability of the data in the sample. The most common level of confidence used is 95%, which means that we expect the true population parameter to lie within the calculated interval in 95 out of 100 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating the margin of error in a confidence interval is:\n",
    "\n",

    "- n = Sample size\n",
